Naming scheme:

<rampspace>_<filespace>.mkv

<rampspace> determines what color range the actual ramp is in, for 2020 the
  image is very wide gamut and will clip on conventional monitors.

<filespace> determines the primaries and colormatrix the file itself was
  encoded with. 2020nc and 2020c should have identical results for correct
  implementations.

NOTE: 2020_709.mkv has clipped values, because the source ramp is in a wider
        gamut than the output space.
